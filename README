Priv8
=====
This is a Firefox addon that uses part of the security model of Firefox OS to creates sandboxes per tabs.
Each sandbox is completely separated from the rest of firefox: it doesn't share cookies, history, storages, etc.
Also the addons could have hard time to work in the sandboxes.

Each sandbox has a name and a color so that it's always easy to identify which tab is sandboxed.
Of course, multiple tabs running in the same sandbox, share cookies, history and so on.

This addon has been written in half day, it's not stable, and it can be dangerous for the integrity of your firefox profile.

Priv8 is released under Mozilla Public License.
