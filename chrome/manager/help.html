  <p>Hi! I am Andrea Marchesini and I have written and maintained priv8 since 2013.</p><br />
  <p>When I started the implementation, priv8 was meant to be just a proof of concept for a sandboxing tab-based privacy feature for Firefox. If you are reading this, it means that you must like that idea :)</p>
  <p>Since 2014, other awesome people and I have worked on implementing priv8 into Firefox. We call this feature Containers. You can read more <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/tanvi/2016/06/16/contextual-identities-on-the-web/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Contextual_Identity_Project/Containers" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
  <p>A new feature in Firefox needs a long process for its realization: the implementation must be bullet-proof; the UI must be awesome; it needs to be deeply tested; we need UX and many other important steps.</p>
  <p>At present, we would like to have some feedback from users. What about you? If you are: an active priv8-user, you care about your privacy, you know how to use priv8; It is time for the _next_ step.</p>
  <p>If you would like to help and support this project, install the test-pilot container add-on!</p>
