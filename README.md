Priv8
=====

What is priv8? This is a Firefox addon that uses part of the security model of
Firefox OS to create sandboxed tabs. Each sandbox is a completely separated
world: it doesn't share cookies, storage, and a lots of other stuff with the
rest of Firefox, but just with other tabs from the same sandbox.

Each sandbox has a name and a color, therefore it will be always easy to
identify which tab is sandboxed.

Also, these sandboxes are permanent! So, when you open one of them the second
time, maybe after a restart, that sandbox will still have the same cookies,
same storage, etc - as you left the previous time.

You can also switch between sandboxes using the context menu for the tab.

Here an example: with priv8 you can read your gmail webmail in a tab, and
another gmail webmail in another tab at the same time. Still, you can be logged
in on Facebook in a tab and not in the others. This is nice!

Moreover, if you are a web developer and you want to test a website using
multiple accounts, priv8 gives you the opportunity to have each account in a
sandboxed tab. Much easier then have multiple profiles or login and logout
manually every time!

Priv8 is released under Mozilla Public License.

Manage your tabs in sandboxes increasing your privacy.
